    "description": "The new AirPods — complete with Wireless Charging Case — deliver the wireless headphone experience, reimagined. Just pull them out of the case and they're ready to use with your iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad or Mac. After a simple one-tap setup, AirPods work like magic. They're automatically on and always connected. AirPods can even sense when they're in your ears and pause when you take them out.\n\nTo adjust the volume, change the song, make a call or even get directions, simply say \"Hey Siri\" and make your request. You have the freedom to wear one or both AirPods, and you can play or skip forward with a double-tap when listening to music or podcasts.\n\nCharge your AirPods quickly and easily with the Wireless Charging Case. Just set the case down on a Qi-compatible charging mat and let it charge. The LED indicator on the front of the case lets you know that your AirPods are charging. And when you're away from a charging mat, you can use the Lightning port to charge.\n\nAirPods deliver 5 hours of listening time and 3 hours of talk time on a single charge.† And they're made to keep up with you, thanks to a Wireless Charging Case that holds multiple charges for more than 24 hours of listening time.† Need a quick charge? Just 15 minutes in the case gives you 3 hours of listening time or 2 hours of talk time.†\n\nPowered by the all-new Apple H1 headphone chip, AirPods use optical sensors and motion accelerometers to detect when they're in your ears. Whether you're using both AirPods or just one, the H1 chip automatically routes the audio and engages the microphone. And when you're on a call or talking to Siri, an additional speech-detecting accelerometer works with beamforming microphones to filter out external noise and focus on the sound of your voice.",

There’s way more to Apple Watch Series 4 than its appearance, but the way it looks is arguably the one difference that anyone can appreciate.\n\nThe design isn’t so different that Series 4 feels like something different than the Apple Watch on your wrist though. It’s absolutely the biggest external change to Apple Watch since the original, but I’ve encountered a number of existing Apple Watch users who can’t immediately pinpoint what’s different.\n\nI think that’s partly because the first three Apple Watches pulled off a great illusion: blending a thick black bezel with deep black elements using the OLED display. If you’re very familiar with the actual confines of the previous screen, the new rounded corner-to-corner display feels like a serious breakthrough.\n\nWhile design is a major advancement on Apple Watch Series 4, it’s the features that you can’t see and may never need that matter the most.",

The most powerful devices are also designed to be durable — iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max feature the toughest glass ever in a smartphone and are rated IP68 for water resistance up to 4 meters for up to 30 minutes, and are protected against everyday spills including coffee and soda.1\nThe new Super Retina XDR display, a custom-designed OLED, provides users an immersive HDR viewing experience for movies and other high-definition video with up to 1,200 nits brightness. Super Retina XDR features wide color support with system-wide color management and True Tone to offer a more natural viewing experience. With a 2 million-to-one contrast ratio with true blacks, pro users can enjoy a more vivid viewing experience for HDR videos and photos, and the Super Retina XDR display is even more power efficient. Customers can interact with their favorite apps in a quick, seamless way with Haptic Touch deeply integrated across iOS 13 to provide app shortcuts for everyday tasks right from the Home screen, including taking a selfie in Camera, checking an appointment in Calendar or previewing email within Mail with just a simple press.\n",

    "description": "Apple in November 2019 replaced the 15-inch MacBook Pro with a new 16-inch model, and later refreshed the 13-inch MacBook Pro in May 2020.\n\nThe higher-end larger MacBook Pro features a larger 16-inch Retina display, slimmer bezels, an updated keyboard with a scissor mechanism instead of a butterfly mechanism, up to 64GB RAM, up to 8TB of storage, and AMD Radeon Pro 5000M Series graphics cards.\n\nThe new 13-inch MacBook Pro also has a scissor switch keyboard along with Intel's 8th and 10th-generation chips, Intel Iris Plus graphics, up to 32GB of RAM, and up to 4TB of storage, with no design or size changes. Apple has discontinued all 15-inch models, and there is no longer a Mac notebook for sale that uses the butterfly keyboard.\n\nThe 16-inch MacBook Pro features a 3072x1920 resolution display and a higher pixel density of 226 ppi, while the 13-inch MacBook Pro features a 2560x1600 resolution with a ppi of 227.

    "description": "When people ask me what’s different about the new Apple Watch Series 4, my immediate answer is simply the design. There’s way more to Apple Watch Series 4 than its appearance, but the way it looks is arguably the one difference that anyone can appreciate.\n\nThe design isn’t so different that Series 4 feels like something different than the Apple Watch on your wrist though. It’s absolutely the biggest external change to Apple Watch since the original, but I’ve encountered a number of existing Apple Watch users who can’t immediately pinpoint what’s different.\n\nI think that’s partly because the first three Apple Watches pulled off a great illusion: blending a thick black bezel with deep black elements using the OLED display. If you’re very familiar with the actual confines of the previous screen, the new rounded corner-to-corner display feels like a serious breakthrough.\n\nWhile design is a major advancement on Apple Watch Series 4, it’s the features that you can’t see and may never need that matter the most.",
